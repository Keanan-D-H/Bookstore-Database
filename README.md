Bookstore-Database 

This project is designed to create a database for a bookstore. In the database 'ebookstore' a table called 'book' is created which has the columns of 'ID' , 'Title', 'Author' and 'Quantity'. A user will be able to add books to the database, update books in the database, delete books in the database and search for a book using either the title and author or using the book ID.
This program will start by populating the database with records containing IDs between 3001 - 3005, so if you wish to try searching or updating or deleting you will be able to use these book records. 

Please ensure you have sqlite3 downloaded.

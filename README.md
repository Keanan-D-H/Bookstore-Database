# Bookstore-Database 

Welcome to **Bookstore-Database**! This project allows users to maintain and browse a database of books as would be kept by a bookstore. This program will populate the database initially so that you can use whichever features you want to check out from the beginning. 

## Features

- **Add A New Book** : The user will be asked for the book's title and author. The database will then be checked to see if this book is already in the database, if it is not then it will be ask for an unique ID ( which is checked) and the user will be asked the quantity they have of this book. This information will be added to the database.
- **Update A Book** : The user is able to change any of the information about a book such as the title, authors name, quantity or ID.
- **Delete A Book** : The user can delete a book from the database completely.
- **Search For A Book** : The user can search for a book either by its ID or by its title and author.  

## Installation

To get started please download *Capstone 2 Database.py*. You will be able to use the book IDs '3001' - '3005' if you wish to update, delete or search for books before adding any in. 

Please ensure you have sqlite3 downloaded.
